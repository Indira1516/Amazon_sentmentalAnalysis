Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Amazon customer reviews to determine sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral). Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we aim to extract insights from textual reviews and build a classification model to predict review sentiment based on the text. The project uses a variety of Python libraries and machine learning techniques, such as TF-IDF vectorization and Naive Bayes, to perform sentiment analysis.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains 4,915 Amazon product reviews with the following features:

reviewText: The content of the review provided by the customer.
overall: The rating provided by the reviewer, ranging from 1 (negative) to 5 (positive).
helpful_yes/helpful_no: Votes indicating how many users found the review helpful or not.
day_diff: The number of days between the review date and the present time.
score_pos_neg_diff, score_average_rating, wilson_lower_bound: Statistical scores used for ranking reviews by quality.
The dataset is preprocessed to clean and prepare the text data for analysis.
